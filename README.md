# Explore Baltimore Heritage 101: Community-Based Teaching and Learning Workshop

## About the Resource Directory

The resource directory is generated from a [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ioAOq2iej7eRkoPy1-2vewv7tafmEKeG5wYBMnvjpws/edit?usp=sharing) of primary and secondary sources, educational activities, local heritage projects, related readings, and related online communities.

_This website is based on the [Federal Government 2017](https://github.com/jlord/federal-gov) website created by Jessica Lord. This site uses a "band-aided version" the [sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js) library and tabletop.js to visual data from a Google Spreadsheet._

### Want to use the data in your project?

The data from the spreadsheet is public and accessible through this Google Spreadsheet key: `1ioAOq2iej7eRkoPy1-2vewv7tafmEKeG5wYBMnvjpws`. You can use the Google API to work with it or a library like [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) which will return the contents to you as nice, clean JSON.
