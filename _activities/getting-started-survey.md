I'm interested in pre-class survey to assess how students feels about the actions they'll be asked to take on for the class. Possible questions include:

- Are you comfortable sharing your writing in public?
- Are you comfortable asking for feedback about your writing?

The survey could also include evaluating the familiarity of students with different web applications or resources including:

- Google Drive (especially Google Docs and Google Sheets)
- Facebook
- ProQuest (especially the ProQuest Historic Newspapers Database)

We may want to include a questionnaire about prerequisite materials for the class such as:

- A phone with a camera or a separate digital camera
- A Enoch Pratt Free Library card

Examples of pre-class surveys, assessments, or literacy maps include:

- [A Digital Humanities Pre-Class Questionnaire](https://electricarchaeology.ca/2015/09/17/a-digital-humanities-pre-class-questionnaire/), 2015 September 17
- [Mozilla Learning Web Literacy Map](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy)
