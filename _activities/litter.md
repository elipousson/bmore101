title: "Pick Up Litter and Learn About People and Places"

This litter pick-up activity could be done as a group during class or learners can do the activity independently during their own time. It is intended to encourage reflection on the character of the built environment and teach students how to research

1. Do a litter pick up as a group
2. Reflect on the physical/social experience of picking up litter. Possible questions:
  - Where does litter accumulate?
  - Do you see any public trash cans? Private trash cans?
3. Each learner selects a piece of litter to investigate
4. Learners can investigate questions including:
  - Where did you find it?
  - Where the object made?
  - What is it made of?
  - Where is it purchased?
  - How much did it cost?
  - Who do you think _may_ have purchase it?

Note: I'm interested in drawing parallels between litter and vacant buildings—both function as the excess material remains of a capitalist economy. This also connects to exploring preservation in relationship to stewardship of natural landscapes and public spaces and encourages reflection on the relationship of public spaces to surrounding buildings.

>"One out of every six big trucks in the U.S. is a garbage truck. Their yearly loads would fill a line of trucks stretching halfway to the moon. The creation of products and packaging that end up in those trucks contributes 44 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global warming, more than any other carbon-spewing category. Garbage costs are staggering: New York City alone spent $2.2 billion on sanitation in 2011. More than $300 million of that was just for transporting its citizens’ trash by train and truck – 12,000 tons a day – to out-of-state landfills, some as far as three hundred miles away. How much is 12,000 tons a day? That’s like throwing away sixty-two Boeing jumbo jets daily, or driving 8,730 new Honda Civics into a landfill each morning."
