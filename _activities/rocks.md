>A great variety and quality of native building stones used in Baltimore come from the geologic part of Maryland known as the Piedmont Plateau Province. Roughly the western half of the City of Baltimore lies in the Piedmont Plateau Province. Ranging in age from about 200 million to 1.1 billion years old, Piedmont rocks consist of granite, gneiss (pronounced “nice”), slate, marble, quartzite, and other rocks. Most of these rocks are igneous or metamorphic in origin, but a few rocks have a sedimentary source. The majority are hard, durable, attractive, and polish well, making good building stones.

>The Piedmont Plateau Province is composed of hard, crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks and extends from the inner edge of the Coastal Plain westward to Catoctin Mountain, the eastern boundary of the Blue Ridge Province. Bedrock in the eastern part of the Piedmont consists of schist, gneiss, gabbro, and other highly metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks of probable volcanic origin. In several places these rocks have been intruded by granitic plutons and pegmatites. Deep drilling has revealed that similar metamorphic and igneous rocks underlie the sedimentary rocks of the Coastal Plain. Several domal uplifts of Precambrian gneiss mantled with quartzite, marble, and schist are present in Baltimore County and in parts of adjacent counties. Differential erosion of these contrasting rock types has produced a distinctive topography in this part of the Piedmont.
