title: "HIST 411 (Public History Methods): Explore Baltimore Heritage 101"
---

## Introduction

### About the course

Explore about Baltimore’s varied history and vernacular architecture while you develop your skills researching local landmarks, writing stories, creating engaging visuals, and doing community outreach. You can expect hands-on activities, a mix of in-person and online discussion, and opportunities to share your writing in public. The class includes field trips to archives and historic sites, presentations by local historians and activists, and introductory workshops on digital history, interpretive programs, and advocacy. You won’t just learn the history of Baltimore; you’ll learn to write your history of Baltimore.

This hybrid course will typically meet in-person at the [Lion Brothers Company Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Brothers_Company_Building) on Tuesday evenings from May 30 to July 11, 2017, 6:00 pm to 9:10 pm. The class will also include a mix of field trips and online presentations on Thursdays, June 1 to July 13 (schedule TBD).

In this class, you are invited to pick from a menu of hundreds of historic places located in neighborhoods in Baltimore and Baltimore County. I plan to ask students to put their research, writing, and visual design skills to work as they create short stories about these places for local residents, students, and educators to discover using the Explore Baltimore Heritage [website](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/) and app. This service learning opportunity is supported by [Baltimore Heritage](https://baltimoreheritage.org/), a nonprofit advocate for historic preservation and heritage education, and a variety of neighborhood-based partner organizations.

_This is an open, in-progress syllabus. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact Eli Pousson at pousson@baltimoreheritage.org or [@elipousson](https://twitter.com/elipousson/) on Twitter._

### Disability Statement

UMBC is committed to eliminating discriminatory obstacles that may disadvantage students based on disability.  Student Support Services (SSS)  is the UMBC department designated to:

- receive and maintain confidential files of disability-related documentation, 
- certify eligibility for services, 
- determine reasonable accommodations, 
- develop with each student plans for the provision of such accommodations, and 
- serve as a liaison between faculty members and students regarding disability-related issues.

If you have a disability and want to request accommodations, contact SSS in the Math/Psych Building, Room 213 or Academic IV-B wing Room 345 (or call 410-455-2459 or 410-455-3250). SSS will require you to provide appropriate documentation of disability and complete a Request for Services form available on [myUMBC](http://my.umbc.edu/groups/sss).  If you require accommodations for this class, make an appointment to meet with me to discuss your SSS-approved accommodations.

<!-- TODO: Consider adapting the Disability Statement above into a Universal Learning Statement. See this example from [ProfHacker](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/accessibility-statements-on-syllabuses/52079):

>I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.

>Any student with particular needs should contact [Name], the Academic Access and Disability Resources Coordinator, at the start of the semester. The Dean of Students’ office will forward any necessary information to me. Then you and I can work out the details of any accommodations needed for this course.
